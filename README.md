# PM2.5-Pollutant-Concentration-Prediction
PM2.5 Pollutant level prediction (Regression)

This Machine learning project predicts the concentration level of the PM2.5 pollutant in the atmosphere given meteorological data. The regression model was built using various Machine learning and statistical techniques employing Python packages like Scikit-learn. To analyze the model, different regression models such as Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Random Forest regressor and SVR were explored. Detailed analysis of model feasibility and error bounds were also performed.

The data for this project was taken from UCI machine learning repository
